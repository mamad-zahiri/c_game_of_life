A John Conway game of life rewrote by me

It is just a Zero-player game and I make it from this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjhFafydYCc

I add two another features to it
 -  It can get the width from user
 -  It has colored

for sea the colored mode go to colored/
for sea the getValueFromUser mode go to getValueFromUser/
